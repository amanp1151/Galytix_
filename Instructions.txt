Here are the instructions to run the application.
1) Run the server after opening Galytix.WebApi.sln. It will run on http://localhost:9091.
2) Use postman or any other tool to hit the url:-http://localhost:9091/api/gwp/avg with POST request, 
    also add the parameters country and lob(lineOfBusiness) in the body for example:-
       {    "country" :"ae",
          "lob":"transport,freight"
         }

3) the average sums should be received in the response like 
        {"transport":[27,84,25,376.0000],"freight":[26,11,96,384.0000]}

[Due to time constraint was unable to retrieve values from appsetting.json file and if there would have been some 
 more time would have added Invalid Country Code exception and Invalid lineOfBusiness exception]
